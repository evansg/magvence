Vence
The history of Vence goes back to the beginning of the early Stone Age. Tribes found a safe haven for themselves and their livestock here, and had access to water at the foot of the Baous (cliffs), thanks to the Rivers Var and Loup.
The Nerusians, a small Celto-Ligurian tribe, settled here and founded Vintium which we now call Vence. The Romans then occupied Vence from 151 BC. Artifacts and remains from the Ligurian, Gallo-Roman and Roman eras can still be seen in the town. Tourists enjoy walking on the section of Roman road along the rue de la Coste.
Around the Third Century, the village converted to Christianity, and a century later the diocese of Vence was founded. They built their Cathedral in the Place Clemenceau, on the site of the Roman temple dedicated to Mars.

Around the Third Century, the village converted to Christianity, and a century later the diocese of Vence was founded. They built their Cathedral in the Place Clemenceau, on the site of the Roman temple dedicated to Mars. Amongst the bishops of Vence, there was a Pope, Paul the III, two academicians, Godeau and Surian, and two saints: Véran and
Lambert. The Cathedral contains Gallo- Roman reliefs and Roman inscriptions.
The town then fell into the hands of the Barons of Villeneuve who, with the help of the bishops held the town until the French Revolution. Vence is now part of the Diocese of Nice.
Vence is twinned with the market town of Stamford, Lincolnshire.

is famous for its AUTUM water ‘La Foux’
The old town is still a tight, walled circle of medieval buildings, much as it appeared hundreds of years ago.
Five medieval “portes” (gateways) give access to the heart of the city:
• Portail Levis (13th c.),
• Porte du Peyra (1441);
• Tour-Porte du Signadour (13th cen.)
also called Portail Saint-Paul)
• Porte du Faubourg also called Pontis;
• Porte d’Orient, also called Porte du
Siegeor or Porte de Cagnes or Porte de la Brèche (18th c.).
These ‘portes’ were made and the buildings realigned so Monseigneur Pisani de la Gaude, Bishop of Vence, could arrive at the door of his episcopal palace without stepping down from
his carriage.
Inside the walls, there are terrace cafés on the Place Clémenceau, with a view of the beautifully decorated church and the activity of this busy square. Outside the walls, near the Porte de Peyra, the terrace cafés beneath the plane trees facing the Place du Grand Jardin are great for sitting and watching the comings and goings
of this vibrate town.

Artists
Vence is a town of artists, with painters, sculptors and writers of many nationalities living and working here.
The town is full of galleries and
other examples of their work, with sculptures, decorated buildings and frequent (summertime) outdoor exhibits. The 12th-century troubadour Pierre Vidal called Vence “le doux repaire” (the sweet nest), and in the13th century, Dante Alighieri included Romeo de Villeneuve, Lord of Vence, in his Paradise. Other famous painters who worked in Vence include Dufy, Soutine, Matisse, Chagall and Dubuffet.
In 1930, D. H. Lawrence spent his last days in Vence, and was buried here; he was later dug up and taken to
New Mexico. Another internationally known writer (and seer and doctor), Nostradamus, had something good to say:
“Garden of Vence, marvel of Provence”.

Even the water is special in Vence. Coming from a source just above the village, the clear mineral water of “La Foux” is available to the villagers from fountains in different parts of the village, including the beautiful 1822 fountain in the Place
Peyra where an old marble plaque lists the amounts of the different minerals present. The water is considered so good, that there are often lines at some of the fountains as people
fill bottles and jugs to take home for consumption.

Vence has been a market town for centuries, and the core of the food market is along the very narrow rue du Marché inside the walls. Flowers,
fish, honey, bakeries, endless variety of fresh vegetables, herbs and spices all add their colors and fragrances to the feeling of the markets.
Chapelle Matisse

Dominicaines de Vence, which was designed and decorated by Henri Matisse.
